# 🚀 AI Cover Letter & Resume Generator

**Generate hyper-personalized cover letters and resumes that bypass AI detection and land interviews.**

**Our AI-generated content sounds like this:**
> "Your recent Series C funding and expansion into enterprise automation signals a critical inflection point where technical debt could either accelerate or constrain growth. My experience architecting scalable systems positions me to help you navigate this transition..."
